## Expression
7. ALP to find the Greatest Common Diviser of two unsigned integer.
8. ALP to find the Sum and average of unsigned integer.
9. Develop and execute an ALP to compute factorial of a positive integer number using recursive procedure.

## Conversion
10. ALP for conversion of 16-bit HEX number into its equivalent BCD number. 
11. ALP for conversion of 16-bit BCD number into its equivalent HEX number.
12. ALP for conversion BCD number 7-Segment String.
13. ALP to copy the string of successive memory locations from one memory to other.
    a. Using string instructions
    b. Without using string instruction

## Sorting
14. ALP to Sort a set of unsigned integer numbers in ascending/ descending order using Bubble sort algorithm.

## Searching
15. Develop and execute ALP that implements Binary search algorithm. The data consists of sorted 16 bit unsigned integers. The search key is also a 16 bit unsigned integer.
